# Huawei HMS AGC Services
## Introduction
This package enables parts of HMS and AGC Services in Unity for Android Build, which is implemented by wrapping Hms SDK. Name and usage of corresponding classes and functions are the same. You can write code by referring [Huawei Hms SDK document](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/HMS-Guides/account-introduction-v4) and [Huawei Agc SDK document](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-Guides/agc-introduction). 

But still there are still some differences during development. please refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.unity.cn/cn/Packages-cn/com.unity.huaweiservice@1.3/manual/) during your development.
